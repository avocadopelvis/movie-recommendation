# SOFT COMPUTING PROJECT
A hybrid approach to improving collaborative filtering movie recommendation system's performace's using kNN &amp; genetic algorithm.

- `main.cpp` contains all the implemented algorithms.
- `userdatageneration.cpp` creates random user ratings of the movies.
- `movie.txt` is a dataset of movie titles.

# HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT?

First, run `userdatageneration.cpp` to create random user ratings of the movies. Then run `main.cpp` to get recommendations for a particular user based on similar users found.

# TASKS
- [x] Implement kNN
- [x] Create Indian movies dataset
- [ ] Save the similar user ratings as .bin file
- [ ] Make report
